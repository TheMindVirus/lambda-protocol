Lambda - Greek Lower-Case Letter, Physics Symbol for Wavelength, Logo of the Half-Life series of games by Valve \
Lambda - Also the name given to a function object generator to be called later with different data in Python

What happens if Portal becomes a mini-game or simulation for the purpose of unlocking in-universe (or otherwise real) doors? \
Can you run Portal inside another game? Can you use Portal Test Chamber completion to trigger real-world events? \
What happens when the virtual world intersects and connects with the virtual virtual world?
